Purchaser Name: EUROPEAN BORDER AND COAST GUARD AGENCY (FRONTEX). Summary: Shipborne Vtol Uas Deployment with Data Fusion and Integration Services. Description: The surveillance of the EU-s land and sea borders is a fundamental component of the European integrated Border Management (EIBM) as identified by the Multiannual Strategic Policy for EIBM 2023-2027 . Border surveillance requires effective operational measures taken by Frontex and Member States- border management authorities. The Technical and Operational Strategy for EIBM states that these measures should be intelligence-driven and risk-based, drawing on multi-domain sensor networks. The multipurpose surveillance-oriented approach, as described in the Capability Roadmap of the EBCG , will require the deployment of integrated, interoperable and inter-connected capabilities that will enable persistent border surveillance, including unmanned systems such as UAS and satellites. Integrated solution for border surveillance combining shipborne Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) with Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) with data fusion and integration from additional sources has the objective to provide an enhanced level of detail and accuracy in understanding border activity, thereby enabling more effective surveillance and response. Based on operational capability requirements and previous research efforts, through this Pilot Project the Agency intends to continue evaluating unmanned systems technologies and their capabilities in delivering integrated aerial maritime surveillance, while assessing operational performance, cost-efficiency, and reliability. &lt;br&gt; Doc Title: Shipborne VT....

Border surveillance requires effective operational measures taken by Frontex and Member States- border management authorities. The Technical and Operational Strategy for EIBM states that these measures should be intelligence-driven and risk-based, drawing on multi-domain sensor networks. The multipurpose surveillance-oriented approach, as described in the Capability Roadmap of the EBCG , will require the deployment of integrated, interoperable and inter-connected capabilities that will enable persistent border surveillance, including unmanned systems such as UAS and satellites. Integrated solution for border surveillance combining shipborne Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) with Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) with data fusion and integration from additional sources has the objective to provide an enhanced level of detail and accuracy in understanding border activity, thereby enabling more effective surveillance and response. Based on operational capability requirements and previous research efforts, through this Pilot Project the Agency intends to continue evaluating unmanned systems technologies and their capabilities in delivering integrated aerial maritime surveillance, while assessing operational performance, cost-efficiency, and reliability. &lt;br&gt; Doc Title: Shipborne VT...", "Published_Date": "2025-11-19", "Closing_Date": "2025-11-24", "Competition": "ICB", "Financier_Name": "European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex)", "CPV": "73000000,34711200,35120000", "Sector": "Research and Development", "Sub_Sector": "Research and Development", "More_Details": "https://tendersontime.com/register/"}}

Description: A PIN announces the OMC of a future PCP for the development of ICT tools for energy monitoring and management. PCP is an approach that allows public procurers to buy R&amp;D from several competing suppliers in parallel, to compare alternative solution approaches, and to identify the best valueformoney solutions that the market can deliver to address their needs. It is split into three phases: solution design, prototype implementation, and validation and demonstration of the solutions. In PCP, there is a riskbenefit sharing under market conditions between the public procurer and the suppliers, and a clear separation between the PCP and the deployment of commercial volumes of endproducts. PCP procurement is exempted from the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), the EU public procurement directives and the national laws that implement them. Overall, the OMC aims to: (1) Validate the findings of the preliminary stateofthe art analysis and the viability of the set of technical and financial provisions.

Summary: Open Market Consultation (Omc) for a Future Precommercial Procurement (Pcp) for the R&amp;D (Research &amp; Development) Services on Ict Tools for Energy Monitoring and Management. Description: A PIN announces the OMC of a future PCP for the development of ICT tools for energy monitoring and management. PCP is an approach that allows public procurers to buy R&amp;D from several competing suppliers in parallel, to compare alternative solution approaches, and to identify the best valueformoney solutions that the market can deliver to address their needs. It is split into three phases: solution design, prototype implementation, and validation and demonstration of the solutions. In PCP, there is a riskbenefit sharing under market conditions between the public procurer and the suppliers, and a clear separation between the PCP and the deployment of commercial volumes of endproducts. PCP procurement is exempted from the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), the EU public procurement directives and the national laws that implement them. Overall, the OMC aims to: (1) Validate the findings of the preliminary stateofthe art analysis and the viability of the set of technical and financial provisions. (2) Raise awareness of the industry and relevant stakeholders regarding the potential future PCP. (3) Collect insights from the industry and relevant stakeholders to finetune the tender specifications and publish a more qualitative tender. All OMC activities, including surveys, the Q&amp;A document, webinars (dates and content) as well as registration information will be published for transparency purposes (Ogłoszenie o konsultacjach rynkowych dotyczących wyzwań badawczych z obszaru ....

Description: The surveillance of the EU-s land and sea borders is a fundamental component of the European integrated Border Management (EIBM) as identified by the Multiannual Strategic Policy for EIBM 2023-2027 . Border surveillance requires effective operational measures taken by Frontex and Member States- border management authorities. The Technical and Operational Strategy for EIBM states that these measures should be intelligence-driven and risk-based, drawing on multi-domain sensor networks. The multipurpose surveillance-oriented approach, as described in the Capability Roadmap of the EBCG , will require the deployment of integrated, interoperable and inter-connected capabilities that will enable persistent border surveillance, including unmanned systems such as UAS and satellites. Integrated solution for border surveillance combining shipborne Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) with Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) with data fusion and integration from additional sources has the objective to provide an enhanced level of detail and accuracy in understanding border activity, thereby enabling more effective surveillance and response.

Description: The surveillance of the EU-s land and sea borders is a fundamental component of the European integrated Border Management (EIBM) as identified by the Multiannual Strategic Policy for EIBM 2023-2027 . Border surveillance requires effective operational measures taken by Frontex and Member States- border management authorities. The Technical and Operational Strategy for EIBM states that these measures should be intelligence-driven and risk-based, drawing on multi-domain sensor networks. The multipurpose surveillance-oriented approach, as described in the Capability Roadmap of the EBCG , will require the deployment of integrated, interoperable and inter-connected capabilities that will enable persistent border surveillance, including unmanned systems such as UAS and satellites. Integrated solution for border surveillance combining shipborne Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) with Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) with data fusion and integration from additional sources has the objective to provide an enhanced level of detail and accuracy in understanding border activity, thereby enabling more effective surveillance and response.
