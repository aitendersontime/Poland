Description: A PIN announces the OMC of a future PCP for the development of ICT tools for energy monitoring and management. PCP is an approach that allows public procurers to buy R&amp;D from several competing suppliers in parallel, to compare alternative solution approaches, and to identify the best valueformoney solutions that the market can deliver to address their needs. It is split into three phases: solution design, prototype implementation, and validation and demonstration of the solutions. In PCP, there is a riskbenefit sharing under market conditions between the public procurer and the suppliers, and a clear separation between the PCP and the deployment of commercial volumes of endproducts. PCP procurement is exempted from the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), the EU public procurement directives and the national laws that implement them. Overall, the OMC aims to: (1) Validate the findings of the preliminary stateofthe art analysis and the viability of the set of technical and financial provisions.

Border surveillance requires effective operational measures taken by Frontex and Member States- border management authorities. The Technical and Operational Strategy for EIBM states that these measures should be intelligence-driven and risk-based, drawing on multi-domain sensor networks. The multipurpose surveillance-oriented approach, as described in the Capability Roadmap of the EBCG , will require the deployment of integrated, interoperable and inter-connected capabilities that will enable persistent border surveillance, including unmanned systems such as UAS and satellites. Integrated solution for border surveillance combining shipborne Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) with Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) with data fusion and integration from additional sources has the objective to provide an enhanced level of detail and accuracy in understanding border activity, thereby enabling more effective surveillance and response.
