Description: The surveillance of the EU-s land and sea borders is a fundamental component of the European integrated Border Management (EIBM) as identified by the Multiannual Strategic Policy for EIBM 2023-2027 . Border surveillance requires effective operational measures taken by Frontex and Member States- border management authorities. The Technical and Operational Strategy for EIBM states that these measures should be intelligence-driven and risk-based, drawing on multi-domain sensor networks. The multipurpose surveillance-oriented approach, as described in the Capability Roadmap of the EBCG , will require the deployment of integrated, interoperable and inter-connected capabilities that will enable persistent border surveillance, including unmanned systems such as UAS and satellites. Integrated solution for border surveillance combining shipborne Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) with Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) with data fusion and integration from additional sources has the objective to provide an enhanced level of detail and accuracy in understanding border activity, thereby enabling more effective surveillance and response.
